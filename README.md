## 📊 Database Tables

| Table          | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **books**      | Stores book title, author, genre, publication, and availability |
| **users**      | Registered user details                                         |
| **admin**      | Admin credentials for login                                     |
| **search_log** | (Optional) Stores search activity for analysis                  |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User searches** for a book using a keyword or author name.
2. **Django backend** fetches relevant data from MySQL using ORM queries.
3. **Results page** dynamically displays all matching books.
4. Admin can manage the book list and add new entries through a dashboard.

## 🧾 Future Enhancements

* Add **Book Recommendation** feature using AI/ML.
* Integrate with **Google Books API** for external book data.
* Enable **User Accounts** with saved favorites and ratings.
* Implement **REST API** endpoints for mobile or external integrations.
